Center for Comprehensive Informatics, Emory University

OVERVIEW

Welcome to the AIW i2b2 ETL query results handler. It implements support for
loading data and abstractions retrieved and computed by Protempa into i2b2.

WHAT'S NEW

Version 1.0.2 is the first externally available version.

REQUIREMENTS

The current version is known to work with Oracle Java 6. It is expected to work
with OpenJDK 6 as well. It is incompatible with Java 7.

This package uses the Maven build system, available from 
http://maven.apache.org. You must install maven, if you do not already have it,
to work with the source code. We use Maven 3.

AIW i2b2 ETL is a "plugin" to the Protempa temporal query system, which is
available from the same site where you got this software.
